# Exploratory Data Analysis on Zomato Dataset

## Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset to uncover insights and patterns about restaurants, cuisines, ratings, and more. The main goal is to analyze the dataset and derive actionable insights that can help understand customer preferences and restaurant performance.

## Objectives
- Understand the structure of the dataset.
- Clean and preprocess the data.
- Analyze various features like ratings, locations, cuisines, and prices.
- Visualize data to identify trends and insights.

## Dataset
The Zomato dataset used in this project contains information about:
- Restaurants
- Cuisines
- Ratings and reviews
- Average costs for two
- Locations

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Importing:** Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data.
3. **Data Exploration:**
   - Summarized data using descriptive statistics.
   - Analyzed distributions of ratings, costs, and cuisines.
4. **Data Visualization:**
   - Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - Analyzed geographical data and patterns in restaurant ratings.
5. **Insights and Findings:** Identified trends and correlations in the data.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Insights
- Distribution of restaurant ratings and their implications.
- Most popular cuisines and their locations.
- Correlation between average costs and ratings.
- Identified high-performing locations for restaurants.

## Visualizations
- Bar plots and pie charts for cuisine analysis.
- Heatmaps for correlation analysis.
- Line plots and scatter plots for cost vs. ratings.
